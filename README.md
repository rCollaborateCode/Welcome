Welcome
=======

Welcome to /r/CollaborateCode's GitHub! I hope to grow this sub into a great source for learning to program, 
and opensource software created as a team. Programming is certainlky easier when you've got people to bounce ideas off
of, and with a dedicated group of people, some pretty great things can be made.

Please feel free to message me, thatsnotgravity, on /r/CollaborateCode if you have any questions or want a project to appear
on here for public use.
